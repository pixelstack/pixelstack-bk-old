      <p>I have sat on the fence for quite some time regarding JS MVC, but recently I have been looking to get into it more and I thought, why not focus on <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, it looks pretty cool and tickled my fancy.
Then during my day job, <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> was the choice. While I was still on the fence about <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>r, it kept making sense to me and after getting a run through <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, it clicked with me and has become my choice.</p>

<p>This has really given me a lot of drive for learning <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>. I have believed for a couple of years now that having a light front-end that  communicates with a back-end API of some sort, whether that back-end API be running <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Nodejs</a>, <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> or whatever serverside framework you prefer. It makes complete sense as you have this very flexible model to work with. Need a native app, no worries, want to change your front-end easily, no worries, whatever it may be, having this separation allows for a great deal of flexibility which is nice.</p>

<p>So my journey has already begun, watching plenty of videos, soaking them in like a sponge. Now to get my hands dirty.</p>

<p>I do have some thinking/toying to do with changing my workflow a bit, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> has been playing a large part, but I think using <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> will be the way to go from here on. It brings some great tools together, <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> for example.</p>

<p>Time to get cracking!</p>
