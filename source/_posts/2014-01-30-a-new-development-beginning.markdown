excerpt: "Angular VS Ember, but what should I go with Ember looks awesome and makes more sense to me, but Angular seems to be more of a fit your own styles"

I have sat on the fence for quite some time regarding JS MVC, but recently I have been looking to get into it more and I thought, why not focus on [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/), it looks pretty cool and tickled my fancy.
Then during my day job, [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) was the choice. While I was still on the fence about [Angular](http://angularjs.org/)r, it kept making sense to me and after getting a run through [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), it clicked with me and has become my choice.

This has really given me a lot of drive for learning [Angular](http://angularjs.org/). I have believed for a couple of years now that having a light front-end that  communicates with a back-end API of some sort, whether that back-end API be running [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) or whatever serverside framework you prefer. It makes complete sense as you have this very flexible model to work with. Need a native app, no worries, want to change your front-end easily, no worries, whatever it may be, having this separation allows for a great deal of flexibility which is nice.

So my journey has already begun, watching plenty of videos, soaking them in like a sponge. Now to get my hands dirty.

I do have some thinking/toying to do with changing my workflow a bit, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) has been playing a large part, but I think using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) will be the way to go from here on. It brings some great tools together, [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for example.

Time to get cracking!
