I have recently started a podcast, [Coder Catchup](http://codercatchup.com/), mainly to have a fireside style chat with other web developers/builders/makers/whatever you want to call yourself, but will also be doing some solo episodes.

I have released 2 episodes, one of them being a brief intro, and the [first official episode](http://codercatchup.com/episodes/7227-episode-001-solo-railsdiff-org) on [railsdiff.org](http://railsdiff.org).

Check it out!
