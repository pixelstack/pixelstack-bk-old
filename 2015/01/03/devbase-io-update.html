      <p>Hi there!</p>

<p>I thought I should put out an update on <a href="http://devbase.io/">devbase.io</a>, my side project for storing/accessing/sharing client information for website logins, hosting accounts, domains, servers etc.</p>

<p>I have started working on redesiging the marketing site, while there is still a lot more work needed to it (looks horrible at the moment), but it is getting there with the limited free time I have (I know, that really isn’t an excuse)</p>

<p>It really is hard designing for yourself, no matter what I do it comes out looking horrible so I scrap it. I am sure I am not the only one.
Anyway, I have been redesigning small parts of the site and so far I have updated the header and parts of the homepage. Soon I will complete the homepage and then the subsequent pages.</p>

<p>I have added in a status page as well, just incase anything happens. Checkout <a href="http://status.devbase.io/">status.devbase.io</a>.</p>

<p>I am also about to start working on some new additions to <a href="http://devbase.io/">devbase</a>, which are on my roadmap, these being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Onboarding experience (currently none, I know I know)</li>
  <li>Issue tracking</li>
  <li>Subscription service billing (Xero)</li>
  <li>Better dashboard</li>
  <li>Quick search</li>
  <li>Swipe gestures</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the ones on my immediate roadmap. I am still taking feedback on devbase, but so far it has all been positive.</p>

<p>That is it for now. If you haven’t tried <a href="http://devbase.io/">devbase.io</a> yet, <a href="https://devbase.io/signup">sign up now and give it a try</a>, it won’t cost you a cent.</p>
